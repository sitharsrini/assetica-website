const faqs = [
  {
    q: "What business valuation services does Assetica offer for family offices in Dubai?",
    a: "Assetica provides family offices in Dubai and across the UAE with a full range of business valuation services including operating company valuations, investment portfolio valuations, cross-border asset valuations, succession and estate planning valuations, and valuations for businesses held within DIFC or ADGM structures. Every engagement is handled with strict confidentiality and delivered by senior valuers with direct principal access.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do family offices need independent business valuations?",
    a: "Family offices require independent business valuations for multiple purposes: estate planning and generational wealth transfer, compliance with UAE corporate tax and transfer pricing regulations, reporting to family principals on portfolio fair value, strategic exit planning, partial disposals to co-investors or institutional buyers, and trust and foundation structuring. An independent valuation from a credible third party protects the family's interests and provides a defensible figure for any regulatory or legal challenge.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Assetica value a business held within a DIFC or ADGM structure?",
    a: "Yes. Assetica has specialist expertise in valuing businesses and investment vehicles held within DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre) and ADGM (Abu Dhabi Global Market) structures. Our valuations are formatted to comply with DFSA and FSRA requirements and are accepted by these regulatory authorities. We regularly work with single and multi-family offices domiciled in both financial free zones.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Assetica handle cross-border family office valuations?",
    a: "Many UAE family offices hold business interests across multiple jurisdictions — Dubai, London, Riyadh, Geneva and Singapore are common combinations. Assetica provides a single-team, multi-jurisdiction valuation service that applies consistent methodology across all asset locations while ensuring compliance with the specific regulatory requirements of each territory. This eliminates the need for a family office to coordinate between separate advisors in each country.",
  },
  {
    q: "What valuation methodology does Assetica use for private business holdings?",
    a: "The appropriate methodology depends on the nature of the business and the purpose of the valuation. For most operating businesses, we apply a combination of Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, market comparables (EV/EBITDA multiples), and precedent transaction analysis. For early-stage or pre-revenue businesses, we use market-based and asset-based approaches. For investment portfolio valuations, we apply IPEV (International Private Equity and Venture Capital) guidelines. Every report documents the methodology clearly and provides a cross-checked valuation range.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Assetica protect the confidentiality of family office clients?",
    a: "Confidentiality is the cornerstone of Assetica's family office service. All engagements begin with a comprehensive NDA. Client information is handled exclusively by the lead valuer and senior team members — never by junior staff or outsourced parties. We do not disclose client identities, portfolio details or valuation outcomes to any third party under any circumstances. Our principals operate on a relationship-first basis, where the privacy and discretion expected by UHNWI and family office clients is built into every aspect of our service.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Assetica provide valuations for succession planning and generational wealth transfer?",
    a: "Yes, succession planning and generational wealth transfer are among the most common valuation requirements for family offices that Assetica serves in the UAE. We prepare independent, defensible valuations for use in family charters, trust structures, family holding company reorganisations, and estate planning frameworks. Our valuations are accepted by UAE legal authorities, international trust companies, and tax advisors in the UK and GCC.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a family office use Assetica's valuations for UAE corporate tax compliance?",
    a: "Yes. Following the introduction of UAE corporate tax at 9% from June 2023, family offices with business interests in the UAE face new valuation requirements for related-party transactions, group restructurings, and transfer pricing compliance. Assetica prepares tax-compliant valuations that satisfy the requirements of the UAE Federal Tax Authority (FTA), including transfer pricing documentation and intra-group transaction valuations for family office structures.",
